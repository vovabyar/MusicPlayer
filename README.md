# MusicPlayer (using State Pattern & Command Pattern)

The project `Music Player`.
Available commands: `TURN ON`, `TURN OFF`, `PLAY`, `STOP`, `NEXT`, `PREV`, `STATUS`, `QUIT`.

During the development, an external `java.media.jmf` library was used (for working with files).

Also in this project, the `command pattern` and the `state pattern` is used.



Here below is a diagram of how the application works via `deterministic finite automaton (DFA)`:
